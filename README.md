# aichatbotwithapi

This project is a voice-enabled AI chatbot that listens to user queries, provides predefined responses for specific questions, and leverages the Google Gemini API for AI-generated responses when needed. The chatbot converts speech to text, processes the input, generates a response, and then converts it back to speech for a seamless interaction.

Key Features & Findings:
Speech Recognition: Uses speech_recognition to capture and convert voice input into text.
Predefined Responses: Provides direct answers to specific questions like life story, superpower, and areas of growth.
AI-Powered Responses: Uses Google Gemini API to generate intelligent replies for general queries.
Text-to-Speech Output: Converts responses into speech using pyttsx3 for a natural conversation flow.
Exit Handling: Recognizes commands like "bye," "quit," and "exit" to gracefully terminate the session.

This chatbot ensures a smooth, interactive, and intelligent voice experience, making it adaptable for real-world AI voice applications.
